It's a function that calls itself. but it has two problems

  1)  They can call to endlessly and fill the memory due to every single call should be remembered
  and allocated memory. 

  We really need to remembere that our memory is limited. what keeps these calls in is 
  the call stack. remember that our codes are read and excecute in call stack

  2) 

  example:  
  function inception(){
    debugger;
    inception();
    
     }

     inception();

     the recursive function has two parths:
           - The recursive case that is to call the function again
           - And the base case that is to stop calling the function there is nothing to search

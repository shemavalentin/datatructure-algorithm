// In Binary Heap, the top value( the parent should be greater than its children)
// In  this case it's now called max heap.
// It can also be a min heap where the parent node is less than the children.
// The binary heap fills it's node from left to right.

// Binary Heaps are mostly used in priority Queue, Data Storage

//                 101
//                /    \
//               72     33
//               /  \    /  \
//              2    45  5   1

// Binary Heap doesn't need to be ordered

//   ==> You are interested in binary Binary Search Tree when we need to find max, or min

// We use methods: findMax();  and findMin() to find the lowest
// LookUp is O(1)

// Difference between Static Arrays and Dynamic Arrays

// => Static arrays are limitted in size: You need to specify number of elements your array will hold ahead of time
// => Dynamic arrays: we can add on them other elements.

// in C++ which uses static arrays ( It is a low level language) and it is why it is faster that high level
// It manages memory.

int a[20];
int b[5] { 1,2,3,4,5} // a static array

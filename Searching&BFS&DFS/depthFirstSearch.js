// Unlike BFS, the DFS traverses each node from left but waits to finish checking with the left
// nodes, veryfies each and every node on the left handside with right at each node
// then go to the right hand side but from left-right.

//  Time complexity o(n) , When traversing over the tree we don't repeat ourselves

// PROS: Less memory, does path exist?: it also looks if the path exist

// CONS: Can get Slow

If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
Answ: BFS

If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:  Answ: We will use BFS cse it will
search to every level untill we find the solution and it won't take too long as DFS.
The solution could be DFS but it will take longer even though BFS will need too much memory.

If the tree is very wide:  Here will use DFS, becouse BFS will need too much memory.

If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS

Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS (This is what DFS has been built for)

Finding the shortest path: BFS

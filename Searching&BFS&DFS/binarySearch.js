// Whether to use linear linear search, we can use binary search if the list is sorted
//
// In binary search we use the divide and conquer as in binary search tree where also the list is sorted

// It is always a golden Idea to store sorted data becouse in the future we will need to search through the list.
// The big O(log N) which is good

// Trees and graphs are the most used as they are good in searching becouse they
// their O(log n) and when we need to visit each node they are the best.

// this uses TRAVERSAL METHOD(BFS)

// In this type of search, it traverses every node from left to right untill reaches the target.

// This has memory implication, it consumes more memoy as we need to traverse each nodes.

// Think of BSF as water flowing. It goes level by level

// their time complexity is O(n)

// PROS :  - shortes path, Closer Nodes
// CONS: More memory
